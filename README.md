# Reflection üìù
## What I had gain from PC Assemble Lab üñ•Ô∏è:
Through the PC assembling activities with my teammates, I gain new knowledge by knowing how to assemble PC and reassemble it. I can see the inner parts on the PC which I never think about it and it makes me so excited to learn. In addition, putting together a PC provides hands-on experience with computer hardware. It compels me to become knowledgeable about the roles, interoperability, and interactions of every component. Besides, gaining an understanding of the connections between the motherboard, CPU, RAM, cooler fan, hard disk, processor and power supply can improve my general understanding of computer design. By assembling PC, my capacity to handle challenges is enhanced by determining the proper connection and fixing during the construction process. I get new experience by enhancing my practical skills because I physically  handle the components, connect wires, and secure pieces in the activities. In that case, I learnt the function of each components in the PC and how it works in the system. Thankyou for Dr. Sarina and the technicians. This activites was fun and great experience for my future use.

## Improvement üí™:
As suggestion to the improve the PC Assemble Lab session, first is through pre-lab materials like video tutorials and in-depth guidelines can be used to build a solid foundation. Before engaging in hands-on activities, these resource give students a basis understanding of the parts and the assembly procedure, which helps to build confidence.

## Others ‚ú®:
We could try others PC after we finish the first one so that we can challenge ourselves whether we really memorize and understand each position of the components and how it works or not.
